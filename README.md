## About The Project

I made give-me-answers initially because of an issue I have with StackOverflow. StackOverflow [pins the accepted answer](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/326095/please-unpin-the-accepted-answer-from-the-top) (chosen by the user that posted the question) to the top. This answer is often not the most highly rated, and frequently will provide outdated information.

I usually want to see the answer first, as in most cases I understand the question before reaching the page.

For that reason, I wanted an extension that would automatically scroll down to the answer with the most votes. Here it is!

The aim is to keep adding sites over time, where I find myself consistently trawling through the page looking for something I maybe saw a snippet of in my search results.

I understand that not everybody is as impatient as myself, so by default, give-me-answers will wait until you click the extension icon to cruise you to your destination. Auto-scroll upon visiting the page can be enabled in the options.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To use this extension, first install it either from source or ~~from the chrome extensions store~~ (coming soon).

Once installed, visit one of the following sites and hit the extension icon in your toolbar:

- Stackoverflow answer
- GitHub issue

If there is an answer with the most votes, you'll jump straight to it.

Enjoy all your free time!
